# Fleet Defense Test Taker

I have to do a monthly safety test as a driver for a contractor for FedEx Ground. The test itself is fairly straightforward stuff. But I decided to have some fun with it and wrote this function to tell me the answers instead of actually reading.

## Current version:
Currently, the function in index.js can be pasted into the console. Then invoke the function with a string that points to the address of currently loaded json test module. (Found in the network tab).  
  
I hope to eventually make this more automated. But I'll have to wait until next month to take another test.
